## Core Concepts

### Variables: The Building Blocks
Variables act as containers for storing data in Java. You declare them with specific types, like `int` for whole numbers, `double` for decimals, `char` for single characters, and `String` for text, and assign values to them. For example:
```java
int age = 25;
String name = "Alice";
```
Variables must follow naming conventions (e.g., camelCase) and can be either **primitive** (e.g., `int`, `boolean`) or **reference** types (e.g., `String`).

### Operators: The Engine of Logic
Operators allow you to manipulate data. Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) perform calculations, while the assignment operator (`=`) stores results. Casting ensures precision when converting between types:
```java
double result = (double) 5 / 2; // result is 2.5
```

### Strings: Working with Text
Strings store sequences of characters and come with powerful methods for manipulation, such as extracting characters (`charAt()`), converting case (`toUpperCase()`), and replacing text (`replace()`). Example:
```java
String greeting = "Hello, World!";
System.out.println(greeting.toUpperCase()); // Output: HELLO, WORLD!
```

### Decision Making: Controlling Flow
The `if` statement executes code based on conditions. Use relational operators (`>`, `<`, `==`) to compare values and control program flow:
```java
int score = 85;
if (score >= 80) {
    System.out.println("Excellent!");
}
```
